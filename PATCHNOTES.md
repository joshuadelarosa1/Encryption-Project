1. Fixed issue with encoding a string with non empty string. Made it to where the
  encoded string just stays empty. (Lines 40 & 87 in VigenereCipher.java)
2. Got rid of some of the magic numbers that were mentioned.
3. Added introductory comments to both of the classes.
4. Updated README.md
5. Combined the encode & decode in CaesarCipher. Added another method to still
  maintain the two extra methods required.
