 The Caesar Cipher & Vignere Cipher encodes by using a formula & then prints it all out. Both of them can also decode & prints it out.


The resources I used for Caesar Cipher were:
https://www.javatpoint.com/string-comparison-in-java: Helped me understand comparing strings
https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/string-char-array-java: gave me more explanation on converting strings to char arrays.

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java-program-to-get-a-character-from-a-string/#: didn't end up using but gave me more information on String.charAt()

The resources I used for Vigenere Cipher were:
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java-string-isempty-method-example/: showed me isempty for the case if the user entered an empty string for the code word

//https://www.edureka.co/blog/system-exit-in-java/#:~:text=exit()%20Method%3F-,System.,by%20terminating%20Java%20Virtual%20Machine: Helped me understand how error checking & exiting in java works
