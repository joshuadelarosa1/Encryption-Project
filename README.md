This submission is for assignment 1 and allows the user to encode and decode using the
Caesar and Vigenere ciphers.
The resources I used for Caesar Cipher were:

https://www.javatpoint.com/string-comparison-in-java: Helped me understand comparing strings
https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/string-char-array-java: gave me more explanation 
on converting strings to char arrays.
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java-program-to-get-a-character-from-a-string/#: didn't end up using but
gave me more information on String.charAt()

The resources I used for Vigenere Cipher were:

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java-string-isempty-method-example/: showed me isempty for the case if
the user entered an empty string for the code word
//https://www.edureka.co/blog/system-exit-in-java/#:~:text=exit()%20Method%3F-,System.,by%20terminating%20Java%20Virtual%20Machine: Helped me understand how error checking & exiting in java works
